"I always wonder where they're going, where they're coming from." \
"It's crazy.Everybody has a different story."

" like the train.All public transportation is good." \
"It's good for the environment.But sometimes... sometimes I hate the train." \
"People always talk to me!Strange people!Is it something about me?" \
"My solution: I listen to it, and people can't talk to me.It always works."
